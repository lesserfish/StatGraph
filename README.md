# StatGraph

Contains statistical methods to analyze graphs, such as graph parameter estimation, model selection based on the GIC (Graph Information Criterion), statistical tests to discriminate two or more populations of graphs (ANOGVA - Analysis of Graph Variability), correlation between graphs, and clustering of graphs.

## For Developers:

### Building:

Before attempting to build this project, make sure that you have all of the requirements needed by running:

> `apt install -y r-base libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev r-cran-tinytex texlive texinfo texlive-fonts-extra curl libcurl4 libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev libfontconfig1-dev`

Once the requirements are installed, you can build the project by running:

    ./build.r`


or

    Rscript build.r

This will generate a statGraph_{*version*}.pdf file containing the documentation and a statGraph_{*version*}.tar.gz file containing the finished library.

### Testing

Test files are located in directory statGraph/tests/testthat/. It is not advisable to attempt to run the test script files directly.

In order to perform tests, run the following:

    ./test.r [Arguments]

The test.r script file has three modes of operation, which can be selected using by passing the appropriate argument.

The arguments that can be passed to test.r consist of the following:

    -a [or no argument passed] - Runs all tests
    -i TEST1,TEST2,TEST3...    - Runs only the tests described in the argument following -i. This has to be a comma separated list of test names.
    -e TEST1,TEST2,TEST3...    - Runs all but the tests described in the argument following -e. This has to be a comma separated list of test names.

For example, the following command only runs the tests graph.param.estimator and graph.model.selection

    ./test.r -i graph.param.estimator,graph.model.selection

### Structure of this project

This project uses the structured of a standard R project. To find out more: https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html

In short: Methods should be added to .R files located in statGraph/R/. To make them public, they have to be exported by adding the corresponding @export tag before their constructors.

More specific guidelines for the structure of this codebase can be found on statGraph/R/README.md and statGraph/tests/testthat/README.md
